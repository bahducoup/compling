1.  - operators: *, -, /, +
    - values: 'hello', -88.8, 5
2.  - variable: spam
    - string: 'spam'
3.  str, int, float
4.  Expressions are made of values and operators. They evaluate to a single value.
5.  An assignment statement stores a value in a variable, whereas an expression ultimately boils down to a single value.
6.  20
7.  'spamspamspam'
8.  Variable names cannot begin with a number.
9.  int(), float(), str()
10. In python, you can't concatenate a str and an int. This can be fixed by explicitly converting the int to a str.
    ex) 'I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.'
